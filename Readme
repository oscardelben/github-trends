This is the source code for http://github-trends.oscardelben.com/ which is a small sinatra app that provides a rss feed for what's popular on Github. Feeds are automatically cached in production mode. There is no expire, but there is a rake task (rake cache:flush) that you can run with cron every 3 hours to flush the cache.

Please Note: if you use rvm I've included a .rvmrc file for myself, but feel free to edit or remove it if you want.
